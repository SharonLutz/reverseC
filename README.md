## reverseC
This package examines the performance of mediation analysis and Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods in the presence of reverse causality. 

## reverseC: Mediation Analysis
A full a description of the R functions that exmamines the role of the exposure on the outcome through the mediator when the outocome is correctly and incorrectly specified are given [here](https://github.com/SharonLutz/reverseC/blob/master/READMEma.md).

## reverseC: Mendelian Randomization
A full a description of the R functions that exmamines the role of the exposure on the outcome when the outocome is correctly and incorrectly specified are given [here](https://github.com/SharonLutz/reverseC/blob/master/READMEmr.md).
